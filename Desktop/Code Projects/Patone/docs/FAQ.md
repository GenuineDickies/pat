## Installation and Setup

### How do I install Patone?

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Set up a MySQL database
3. Configure `config.php` with your database credentials
4. Run the database migration script

See [Developer Setup](./developer/SETUP.md) or [Deployment Guide](./deployment/README.md) for detailed instructions.

### What are the default login credentials?

- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin123`

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Change these immediately after first login!

### How do I change the admin password?

1. Login to the system
2. Click on your profile icon
3. Select "Change Password"

```
(Use bcrypt to hash the password)

### How do I add more administrators?

1. Login as admin
2. Navigate to Settings → Users
3. Click "Add User"
4. Fill in user information
5. Select role as "Admin"
6. Save user

### Can I import existing customer data?

Currently, bulk import is not built-in, but you can:
1. Use the API to programmatically add customers
2. Insert directly into database (customers table)
3. Create a custom import script

Future versions will include CSV import functionality.

## Features and Functionality

### How do I create a service request?

1. Navigate to Requests → Add Request
2. Select or add customer
3. Choose service type
4. Enter location details
5. Set priority level
6. Add description
7. Click "Create Request"

### How do I assign a driver to a request?

1. Open the pending service request
2. Click "Assign Driver"
3. View list of available drivers with distances
4. Select appropriate driver
5. Confirm assignment

The driver will receive notification (if configured).

### Can drivers self-assign requests?

Currently, driver assignment is done by dispatchers/administrators. Driver self-assignment could be added as a custom feature.

### How does GPS tracking work?

GPS tracking requires:
1. GPS tracking enabled in settings
2. Drivers using mobile app or web portal
3. Location permissions granted on driver devices
4. Periodic location updates sent to server

Driver locations are stored in the database and can be viewed on maps (if map integration is added).

### Can I customize service types?

Yes! Navigate to Settings → Service Types:
1. View existing service types
2. Add new service types
3. Edit names, descriptions, pricing
4. Set estimated durations
5. Activate or deactivate services

### How do customer ratings work?

After service completion:
1. Customer can rate the service (1-5 stars)
2. Customer can leave feedback comments
3. Ratings are associated with the driver
4. Average rating displayed on driver profile
5. Ratings help track driver performance

### Can I generate reports?

Yes, Patone includes several report types:
- **Daily Operations Report**: Today's activity summary
- **Monthly Performance Report**: Month-over-month analysis
- **Driver Performance Report**: Individual driver statistics
- **Customer Report**: Customer service history

Reports can be viewed online or exported as PDF/CSV.

### Is there a mobile app for drivers?

Patone provides an API that can be used to build mobile apps. The core platform is web-based, but the API supports:
- Driver login
- View assigned requests
- Update request status
- Update location
- View request details

A mobile app would need to be developed separately using the API.

## API and Integrations

### Does Patone have an API?

Yes! Patone includes a RESTful API for:
- Customer management
- Driver management
- Service request operations
- Dashboard statistics

### How do I authenticate with the API?

Currently, the API uses session-based authentication:
1. Login through the web interface
2. Session cookie is set
3. Include cookie with API requests

For production mobile apps, JWT authentication is recommended (coming in v1.1).

### Can I integrate with third-party services?

Yes, you can integrate with:
- **GPS devices**: Update driver locations via API
- **Payment gateways**: Add payment processing
- **Mapping services**: Google Maps, Mapbox for visualization
