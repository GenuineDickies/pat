## Testing Coverage

### Test Cases Implemented
1. Database connection verification
2. Migration verification (tables exist)
3. Driver workload retrieval
4. Certification CRUD operations
5. Document management operations
6. Availability schedule operations
7. Workload balancing functions
8. Scheduled availability checking

### Test Execution
```bash
cd tests
php DriverManagementTest.php
```

Expected output: All tests pass when migration has been run.

## Security Considerations

### Implemented
- CSRF token validation on all forms
- Input sanitization (using existing helpers)
- File upload validation (type and size)
- Permission checks (manage_drivers)
- SQL injection prevention (prepared statements)
- XSS protection (htmlspecialchars on output)

### Recommended for Production
- File upload malware scanning
- Document encryption at rest
- Access logging for sensitive documents
- Rate limiting on file uploads
- Cloud storage integration (S3, etc.)

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Indexes
All frequently queried columns are indexed:
- Foreign keys (driver_id)
- Date fields (expiry_date)
- Status fields
- day_of_week for scheduling

### Query Optimization
- Efficient JOIN queries for related data
- Pagination support where applicable
- Aggregation done in SQL rather than PHP
- Minimal data transfer

### Caching Recommendations
- Driver schedules (TTL: 1 hour)
- Workload distribution (TTL: 5 minutes)
- Active certifications (TTL: 1 hour)

## Migration Instructions

### Step 1: Backup Database

### Step 2: Run Migration
```bash
cd database/migrations
php 002_driver_management_enhancements.php

### Step 4: Set Permissions
```bash
chmod 755 uploads/drivers/
```

## Rollback Instructions

If needed, rollback migration:
```bash
cd database/migrations
php 002_driver_management_enhancements.php down
```

Then restore from backup:
```bash
mysql -u user -p database < backup_before_driver_management.sql
```
